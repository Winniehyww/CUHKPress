BreakThrough inArtificialHeartValves
Thehuman heart has four chambers separatedby valveswhichdirectthe blood
flow. The actions of some of these valves are controlled by fine strands of tendon and
muscle.Rheumatic heart disease,prevalent in the third world,commonly destroys the mitral
valve,and to a lesserdegree,also the aortic valve,necessitating valve replacement operations
for treatment.
Artificial heart valves are in clinical use since late 60's,and are classified as
mechanical and biological heart valves,with mitral and aortic prostheses assuming similar
design but different sizes. However in real life,the shape and construction of these two
valves are quite different.Mechanical heart valves vary in design and construction as well
as use of metals and material.They have variable durability and known complications such
as material failureleading to fracture of components,blood clot formation,orbleeding from
anticoagulation therapy.
Mechanical valves are non physiological,produce excessive
turbulence and aredestructive to blood components.
Biological heart valves in the past are not without problems,such as early
structural failure from tear of theleaflets making up the valve and secondary failure like
degeneration and calcification,jeopardising therefore long term durability. Failure of the
present biological heart valves are due to use of rigid frame (stent),defective design and
construction,use of three leaflets in place of two leaflets in the mitral position,and lack of
rigid quality controlduring the process of manufacturing
DrBaruah'sextensivelaboratoryresearchhas startedin1982in Glasgow,UK
and his present laboratory is in Bombay where present break-through in development of
artificial heart valveshas taken place. His aim hasbeen to design and construct biological
heart valves close to nature to maintain normal anatomical configuration in the human heart
and produce physiological performance by increasing efficiency of the left heart and
minimising turbulance of blood flow through the heart，reducing thrombogenicity and
eliminating the need for anticoagulation.
Trileaflet biological valves are made from bovine pericardium which is the
tough outer coveringthe ox heart.The new valves are stentless and flexible mimicking our
own natural trileafletaortic and pulmonary valves. Similarly,bileaflet mitral valves with
attendent strands of tendon and muscle made from bovinepericardium simulating our native
mitral valves havebeen developed.Durability,functionality and reliability have been tested
vigorously in the laboratory in Bombay and it is found that these valves are of similar
properties and characteristics as our native valves,capable of life long durability,and
requiring no anticoagulation.
These valves have recently been implanted successfully in Prince of Wales
Hospital,Hong Kongand subsequently by Dr Prabhu Dev in Srijayadeva Institute of
Cardiology,Bangalore,India.

A leading experimental physicist,Professor Peter Townsend will
Professor. He willconducttwo seminars and deliver a public lecture.
Entitled"The NeedforImperfections".the lecture will be held
onThursday.May14at 4:3opm in LectureTheatreLT1.LadyShawBuildingon
theUniversity's Shatin campus. All are welcome.
The lecture will point out some common features of imperfect
materials and how they can be controlled and engineered to advantage
Semiconductors,which are a result of the presence of "defects"，are the most
successful exploitation of imperfect materials. Equally common examples of
defect controlled processes and devices include the photographic process,TV
phosphors,the colour of gem stones,chemical reactivity,solid state lasers
andopticalfibres.
Professor Townsend is Professor of Experimental Physics at the
University of Sussex, where he directs three research groups working on
different aspects of studies of imperfections in insulating materials. The
three groups have made significant achievements in the researches on colour
centres,optical waveguide lasers and optical effects of ion implantation in
glass.
Professor Townsend's visit to The Chinese University is sponsored
by the Wei Lun Visiting Professorship/Fellowship Scheme which invites eminent
scholars in various academic disciplines to give lectures at the University.
The scheme was established through the generous donation by the Wei Lun
Foundation Ltd.
